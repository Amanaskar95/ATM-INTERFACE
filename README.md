Step-by-step Explanation:

1. Defining Bank Account Class: Like a sturdy vault, the BankAccount class is introduced, encapsulating methods for balance retrieval, depositing funds, and withdrawing cash.

2. Defining ATM Class: The ATM class, akin to a trusty ATM machine, is outlined. It requires a BankAccount object and boasts methods for withdrawing, depositing, and checking balances.

3. Main Class: The heart of the program, the Main class, sets the stage for the ATM interface. Inside its main method, a Scanner object eagerly awaits user input.

4. Menu Display and User Input: Like a beacon in the night, a menu beckons the user with options for Withdrawal, Deposit, Balance Check, or gracefully Exiting the program. User input steers the ship.

5. Switch Case: The sails unfurl as distinct operations unfold:

           Withdraw: Users are beckoned to input the desired withdrawal amount. The ATM valiantly attempts to deduct the sum from the account, unveiling the remaining balance.

           Deposit: Choosing to deposit, users are prompted to grace the account with their funds. The deposited sum enriches the account balance, displayed for all to admire.

          Check Balance: Opting to peer into the treasure chest triggers the display of the current account balance.

          Exit: Choosing the path of departure triggers a heartfelt parting message, gently closing the curtains on the program's performance.

          Invalid Choice: Should a lost soul wander into the realm of invalid choices, fear not! They are gently guided back to the path of righteousness, encouraged to try anew.
